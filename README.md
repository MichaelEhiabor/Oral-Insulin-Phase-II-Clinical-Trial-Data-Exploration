# Oral Insulin Phase II Clinical Trial Data Exploration
## by Michael Utomi Ehiabor


## Overview

This document explores three datasets with information about the phase two clinical trial of 350 patients for a new innovative oral insulin called Auralin - a proprietary capsule that can solve the stomach lining problem that has historically been the roadblock when diabetics try to ingest insulin orally



## Dataset

We will be looking at the phase two clinical trial data of 350 patients for a new innovative oral insulin called Auralin - a proprietary capsule that can solve this stomach lining problem.

Phase two trials are intended to:

-Test the efficacy and the dose response of a drug

-Identify adverse reactions

In this trial, half of the patients are being treated with Auralin, and the other 175 being treated with a popular injectable insulin called Novodra. By comparing key metrics between these two drugs, we can determine if Auralin is effective.

## Summary of Findings
Between the two drugs Auralin and Novodra the pure counts of each adverse reaction are pretty similar with the exception of throat irritation for Auralin(the oral insulin) which can be expected because this pill is taken orally and passes by the throat before it gets to the stomach and injection site discomfort for Novodra which is the injectable insulin and that is to be expected because that's a common known adverse reaction for injectable insulin because of needles

Patients that were treated with Auralin on average required 8 more units of insulin to establish a safe, steady blood sugar level. That compared to novodra patients who on average require .4 units less of insulin comparing their start dose and end dose pre-trial and post-trial.

The difference in average Hba1c change for Auralin and Novodra post trail is 0.017. This shows that Auralin is almost as effective as Novodra and we can proceed to Phase 3 of the clinical trail
