## Overview

Oral Insulin Phase II Clinical Trial Data Exploration: This document explores three datasets with information about the phase two clinical trial of 350 patients for a new innovative oral insulin called Auralin - a proprietary capsule that can solve the stomach lining problem that has historically been the roadblock when diabetics try to ingest insulin orally



## Dataset

We will be looking at the phase two clinical trial data of 350 patients for a new innovative oral insulin called Auralin - a proprietary capsule that can solve this stomach lining problem.

Phase two trials are intended to:

-Test the efficacy and the dose response of a drug

-Identify adverse reactions

In this trial, half of the patients are being treated with Auralin, and the other 175 being treated with a popular injectable insulin called Novodra. By comparing key metrics between these two drugs, we can determine if Auralin is effective.
